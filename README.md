# FE595-Sentiment-Sorting

Standardize the format of your file as follows:

1. Name the first column which contains data of company names as "name"
2. Name the second column which contains data of company purpose as "purpose"
3. save the data as "file"

Then sentimentanalysis script can be used to finds the best and worst business idea (based on sentiment analysis), and common10 script can be used to find the 10 most common words/tokens in the description of the companies.
